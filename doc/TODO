TODO for 1.0:
* Separate the tags by close type in the various View sub-classes.  (The most
  tedious thing on the list, but required for compliance.)
* RSS Sub-class of View?  Would be nice.

TODO for later:
* Have html2hoshi do a smarter job of deciding doctypes, not using permissive!
  so much.
* View logic helpers.
