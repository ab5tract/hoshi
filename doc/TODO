TODO for 1.0:
* Have html2hoshi run a simple regex to make sure the tags are all valid method
  names, and use a call to View#tag if not.
* Separate the tags by close type in the various View sub-classes.  (The most
  tedious thing on the list, but required for compliance.)
* Add some support for self-contained CGI scripts.  
* Add self-contained CGI ENV script, the "Hello, World!" of CGI.
* Waves integration.
* RSS Sub-class of View?
